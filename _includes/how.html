              <h3>Play on a traditional squash court</h3>
              <p>The game was originally played on the old-style courts (today's <a href="/images/doubles-squash-court.png">doubles courts</a>). On new courts, the larger service boxes may make scoring too easy. But if that's all you have, then make do.</p>

              <h3>Teams of 3, with equal gender ratio</h3>
              <p>You can play 2v2 or 4v4. In my experience, the former gets tiring very quickly and the latter feels too cramped. But if give it a try if you like. You might find you prefer it.</p>

              <h3>Score by catching the disc in the services box</h3>
              <p>Like ultimate, your first point of contact with the floor after catching the disc must be inside the service box. Jumping off the wall is allowed.</p>

              <h3>Clear the disc after each score and turnover</h3>
              <p>The disc must be "cleared" off the back wall after each goal, each turnover, and at the start of the game. You can can clear the disc by touching the disc to the back wall or by catching a pass off the back wall.</p>

              <h3>Play to 7 points, win by 2, hard at 9</h3>
              <p>If your team has 7 points and the other team has 5 or less, you win. If they have 6, keep playing until one team is winning by 2. If any team gets to 9 points, they win regardless of other team's score.</p>

              <h3>Stall goes to 5</h3>
              <p>If you don't throw the disc within 5 seconds of catching it, it is a turnover. You cannot stall unless you are close enough to touch the person with the disc.</p>

              <h3>Physical play is generally acceptable</h3>
              <p>Boxing out, bodying up, close marks and other contact is allowed. There are no pick calls, though don't set picks on purpose. Only call a foul if it is egregious (e.g. really hard shoves, strips, hitting your hands as you catch the disc, etc)</p>

              <h3>All walls are inbounds</h3>
              <p>If the disc hits the walls or the ceiling, keep playing. You can throw it off the walls on purpose if you'd like. Hitting the floor, however, is a turnover.</p>

        - decide teams by flipping
        - decide O/D by the ol' no-look disc toss to one-hand catch (or up/down call)
        - start play from the T
        - you probably want to throw blades
        - score check on O only
        - you must set your pivot right on the disc. you cannot reach to pick up the disc
        - please be careful. serious injuries are rare, but bumps and bruises are common.
